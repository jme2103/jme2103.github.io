A visualization of the standard map 

$$ \begin{aligned} r_{n+1} &= r_n + \epsilon \sin(\theta_n) \\ \theta_{n+1} &= \theta_n + r_{n+1} \end{aligned} $$ 

as it is perturbed from completely integrable ($\epsilon = 0$) to the coexistence of invariant tori with chaos. Fifty orbits corresponding to fifty initial conditions are plotted as $\epsilon$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.
